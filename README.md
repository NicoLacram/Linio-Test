Challenge â€“ Backend Developer
Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. However, for multiples of 3, instead of the number, print "Linio". For multiples of 5 print "IT". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "Linianos".

But here's the catch: you can use only one if. No multiple branches, ternary operators or else.

Requirements
1 if
You can't use else, else if or ternary
Unit tests

You can write the challenge in any language you want. Here at Linio we are big fans of PHP, Kotlin and TypeScript
